This plugin is now federated to allow integration with other platforms, along with upgrading underlying SDK versions.

We've also added lots of features which can be seen in the changelog below, however notably the biggest changes are:

- Removed all manual native code changes that were originally required for integration - this plugin works
  out of the box once configured with Firebase & APNs.
- Support for macOS.
- iOS background handler support.
- Android background handler debugging and logging support.
- Android V2 embedding support.
- Reworked API for message handling (Streams + explicit handlers).
- Fully typed Message & Notification classes (vs raw Maps).
- New Apple notification permissions & support.
- Detailed documentation.

- **`FirebaseMessaging`**:

  - **BREAKING**: `configure()` has been removed in favor of calling specific static methods which return Streams.
    - **Why?**: The previous implementation of `configure()` caused unintended side effects if called multiple
      times (either to register a different handler, or remove handlers). This change allows developers to be more
      explicit about registering handlers and removing them without effecting others via Streams.
  - **DEPRECATED**: Calling `FirebaseMessaging()` has been deprecated in favor of `FirebaseMessaging.instance`
    & `FirebaseMessaging.instanceFor()`.
  - **DEPRECATED**: `requestNotificationPermissions()` has been deprecated in favor of `requestPermission()`.
  - **DEPRECATED**: `deleteInstanceID()` has been deprecated in favor of `deleteToken()`.
  - **DEPRECATED**: `autoInitEnabled()` has been deprecated in favor of `isAutoInitEnabled`.
  - **NEW**: Added support for `isAutoInitEnabled` as a synchronous getter.
  - **NEW**: Added support for `getInitialMessage()`. This API has been added to detect whether a messaging containing
    a notification has caused the application to be opened via users interaction.
  - **NEW**: Added support for `deleteToken()`.
  - **NEW**: Added support for `getToken()`.
  - **NEW**: [Apple] Added support for `getAPNSToken()`.
  - **NEW**: [Apple] Added support for `getNotificationSettings()`. See `NotificationSettings` below.
  - **NEW**: [Apple] Added support for `requestPermission()`. See `NotificationSettings` below. New permissions such
    as `carPlay`, `crtiticalAlert`, `announcement` are now supported.
  - **NEW**: [Android] Added support for `sendMessage()`. The `sendMessage()` API enables support for sending FCM
    payloads back to a custom server from the device.
  - **NEW**: [Android] When receiving background messages on the separate background Dart executor whilst in debug,
    you should now see flutter logs and be able to debug/add breakpoints your Dart background message handler.
  - **NEW**: [Apple] Added support for `setForegroundNotificationPresentationOptions()`. By default, iOS devices will
    not show notifications in the foreground. Use this API to override the defaults. See documentation for Android
    foreground notifications.
  - **NEW** - [Android] Firebase Cloud Messages that contain a notification are now always sent to Dart regardless of
    whether the app was in the foreground or background. Previously, if a message came through that contained a
    notification whilst your app was in the foreground then FCM would not notify the plugin messaging service of the
    message (and subsequently your handlers in Dart) until the user interacted with it.

- **Event handling**:

  - Event handling has been reworked to provide a more intuitive API for developers. Foreground based events can now
    be accessed via Streams:
    - **NEW**: `FirebaseMessaging.onMessage` Returns a Stream that is called when an incoming FCM payload is
      received whilst the Flutter instance is in the foreground, containing a [RemoteMessage].
    - **NEW**: `FirebaseMessaging.onMessageOpenedApp` Returns a [Stream] that is called when a user presses a
      notification displayed via FCM. This replaces the previous `onLaunch` and `onResume` handlers.
    - **NEW**: `FirebaseMessaging.onBackgroundMessage()` Sets a background message handler to trigger when the app
      is in the background or terminated.

- `IosNotificationSettings`:

  - **DEPRECATED**: Usage of the `IosNotificationSettings` class is now deprecated (currently used with the now
    deprecated  `requestNotificationPermissions()` method).
    - Instead of this class, use named arguments when calling `requestPermission()` and read the permissions back
      via the returned `NotificationSettings` instance.

- `NotificationSettings`:

  - **NEW**: A `NotificationSettings` class is returned from calls to `requestPermission()`
    and `getNotificationSettings()`. It contains information such as the authorization status, along with the platform
    specific settings.

- `RemoteMessage`:

  - **NEW**: Incoming FCM payloads are now represented as a `RemoteMessage` rather than a raw `Map`.

- `RemoteNotification`:
  - **NEW**:When a message includes a notification payload, the `RemoteMessage` includes a `RemoteNotification` rather
    than a raw `Map`.

- **Other**:

  - Additional types are available throughout messaging to aid with the latest changes:
    - `BackgroundMessageHandler`, `AppleNotificationSetting`, `AppleShowPreviewSetting`, `AuthorizationStatus`
      , `AndroidNotificationPriority`, `AndroidNotificationVisibility`

## 7.0.3

 - Update a dependency to the latest release.

## 7.0.2

 - **FIX**: remove `platform` package usage (#3729).

## 7.0.1

 - **FIX**: local dependencies in example apps (#3319).
 - **CHORE**: intellij cleanup (#3326).

## 7.0.0

* Depend on `firebase_core` and migrate plugin to use `firebase_core` native SDK versioning features;
	* Firebase iOS SDK versions are now locked to use the same version defined in `firebase_core`.
	* Firebase Android SDK versions are now using the Firebase Bill of Materials (BoM) to specify individual SDK versions. BoM version is also sourced from `firebase_core`.
* Allow iOS to be imported as a module.

## 6.0.16

* Fix push notifications clearing after app launch on iOS.

## 6.0.16

* Update lower bound of dart dependency to 2.0.0.

## 6.0.15

* Fix - register `pluginRegistrantCallback` on every `FcmDartService#start` call.

## 6.0.14

* Fix for missing UserAgent.h compilation failures.

## 6.0.13

* Implement `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` methods to allow plugin to work when method swizzling is disabled.
* Applications now only need to update their iOS project's `AppDelegate` when method swizzling is disabled.
* Applications that need to use `firebase_messaging` with other notification plugins will need to
  add the following to their iOS project's `Info.plist` file:
  ```xml
  <key>FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled</key>
  <false/>
  ```

## 6.0.12

* Replace deprecated `getFlutterEngine` call on Android.

## 6.0.11

* Make the pedantic dev_dependency explicit.

* `FirebaseMessaging.configure` will throw an `ArgumentError` when `onBackgroundMessage` parameter
is not a top-level or static function.

## 6.0.0

* Use `UNUserNotificationCenter` to receive messages on iOS version >= 10.
* **Breaking Change** For iOS versions >= 10, this will cause any other plugin that specifies a
  `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` to `[UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter]` to
  stop receiving notifications. To have this plugin work with plugins that specify their own
  `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`, you can remove the line
  ```objectivec
  [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter].delegate = // plugin specified delegate
  ```

  and add this line to your iOS project `AppDelegate.m`

  ```swift
  if (@available(iOS 10.0, *)) {
    [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter].delegate = (id<UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate>) self;
  }
  ```

## 3.0.1

* Log a more detailed warning at build time about the previous AndroidX
  migration.

## 3.0.0

* **Breaking change**. Migrate from the deprecated original Android Support
  Library to AndroidX. This shouldn't result in any functional changes, but it
  requires any Android apps using this plugin to [also
  migrate](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) if they're
  using the original support library.

  This was originally incorrectly pushed in the `2.2.0` update.

## 2.2.0+1

* **Revert the breaking 2.2.0 update**. 2.2.0 was known to be breaking and
  should have incremented the major version number instead of the minor. This
  revert is in and of itself breaking for anyone that has already migrated
  however. Anyone who has already migrated their app to AndroidX should
  immediately update to `3.0.0` instead. That's the correctly versioned new push
  of `2.2.0`.

## 2.2.0

* **BAD**. This was a breaking change that was incorrectly published on a minor
  version upgrade, should never have happened. Reverted by `2.2.0+1`.

* **Breaking change**. Migrate from the deprecated original Android Support
  Library to AndroidX. This shouldn't result in any functional changes, but it
  requires any Android apps using this plugin to [also
  migrate](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) if they're
  using the original support library.

## 2.1.0

* Adding support for deleteInstanceID(), autoInitEnabled() and setAutoInitEnabled().

## 2.0.3

* Removing local cache of getToken() in the dart part of the plugin. Now getToken() calls directly its counterparts in the iOS and Android implementations. This enables obtaining its value without calling configure() or having to wait for a new token refresh.
