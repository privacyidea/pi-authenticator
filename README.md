# pi-authenticator
OTP Authenticator App for privacyIDEA Authentication Server

The pi-authenticator currently implements support for HOTP and TOTP (30 and 60 seconds). Supported hashing algorithms are SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512.
It also supports scanning qr codes that match the [Google Authenticator Key URI](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format) format.

The App is best used with the
[privacyIDEA Authentication Server](https://github/privacyidea/privacyidea), and supports both Android and iOS.

# Goals

* provide a more secure way of enrollment as
specified in our
[smartphone concept](https://github.com/privacyidea/privacyidea/wiki/concept%3A-SmartphoneApp) as well as the [pushtoken](https://github.com/privacyidea/privacyidea/wiki/concept%3A-PushToken) with support for user-configured firebase projects

# Development

We use the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework for developing our application. This enables us to use a single code base for both Android and iOS, for development itself we use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with the official [Flutter plugin](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij).

# Tests

Tests are located under `app/test`. These can be run from within Android Studio, if the necessary plugins are installed or directly by running `flutter test` at the root of the project. For additional information please view the official [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing).
